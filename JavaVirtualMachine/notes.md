## Notes

* This book actually has a floppy disk! I guess Java's not
a youngun anymore.

* I did not know that Java started as Oak. Good to know.

* Author disparages Java's speed, which is somewhat inappropriate
to do in a book about Java, but I'm not sure he really had a way
to know of the improvements that would be made in JIT technology.
