## Android study notes

I went along with https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html
which I think is good. I'm really pissed at all of the xml I'm seeing
in Android Studio. JSON 4 LIFE, HOMIEZ! Another annoyance was how
many steps I had to go through to put my phone in developer mode.

Android stores strings in a file called "res/values/strings.xml"
and refers to them as variables elsewhere. Why are things done this way?
Maybe it allows you to swap out xml files for different locales to make
translation easier?

What is the intent stuff in the Android code?
