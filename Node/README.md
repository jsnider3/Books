# README

This is me going through the node tutorial available at https://www.nodebeginner.org/

## Notes

"One being that as of now, Node.js is just one single process and it can run on
only one single CPU core."

That quote from the book stood out to me. I wasn't sure how you could run a web server with a
single process, but apparently that actually works well and you can just create child processes
for anything CPU-intensive.

## Linked Articles

The book also linked to http://debuggable.com/posts/understanding-node-js:4bd98440-45e4-4a9a-8ef7-0f7ecbdd56cb,
which was informative, but partially outdated.
