LIKE is one way of matching strings. REGEXP_LIKE(column, regex) is
another way which is more powerful. REGEXP_LIKE tries to find a string
inside the column that matches the regex, it doesn't necessarily try to
match the entire column.

HackerRank spends more time than is necessary repeating things.

RIGHT and LEFT are basically wrappers for substrings, but pretty
convenient. It's unfortunate that ORACLE doesn't have them.

ROWNUM can be used to limit results to the first N, if you want the
last N just sort in the other direction.

Today was the first time being exposed to the idea of pivots. They
seem cool even though I am completely confused by what they are. My
biggest complaint about HackerRank is the lack of tutorials.

BETWEEN is kind of COBOL-esque why not just have A <= B <= C?

ORACLE has really bad documentation, but basically Oracle has CASE,
WHILE, and IF/THEN/ELSE for control flow which work as expected.
