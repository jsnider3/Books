# Why Go? Sneaking Go into corporate life.
## By: Ryan Richins

How did comcast get Go? AOL started bleeding and some of its talent
wanted to bring Go over. They started writing monitoring tools, which
eventually grew into internal applications and just keep growing.

Tech stack was originally Ruby with Merb, Sinatra, and Padrino. Server
stuff was Eventmachine and AnyEvent.

They didn't want to do C++, Java, or .Net and ended up considering
Erland, NodeJS, and Go.

They wanted easy to use code with a community.

How to get other people to use it?
Use it for your own code, make proof of concepts, get QA approval.

# Non-Orthogonal Choices in Go

i.e. places where we can have multiple features that cover something.

An example is loops vs recursion.

Dynamic behavior, a function delegates some of its implementation to
functions that are passed in as arguments. This is basically how
interfaces work.

A very powerful feature of Go is that you can have an interface
use objects that satisfy it even if they don't explicitly implement it.
