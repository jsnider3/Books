#### A list of terms that I had to look up, ordered by when I looked them up:

* tenor - The time from strike to expiry date of an option.
* forward - A contract to buy or sell at a future date at a given price.
            An option that is guaranteed to be above the strike price is
            equivalent to a forward.
* exercise price - same as strike price.
* delta hedging - Buying and selling the underlying of an option in order
  to create a portfolio that does not change value after small changes
  in the underlying's price.
* Markowitz portfolio optimization - Also known as modern portfolio theory,
  based on diversying assets in order to minimize the unsystematic risk for
  a given risk tolerance.
