# The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels by Alex Epstein

## Background
I have a coworker who's an Objectivist, when I went to his office
last time to ask him about something I noticed this book on his shelf.
As a side note, Alex Epstein is himself a former writer for the Ayn
Rand Institute.

This book seems like something I'm going to disagree with a lot, but
I'm reading it out of intellectual curiosity.

## Chapter 1 The Secret History of Fossil Fuels

The author starts out sounding like a twisted reflecion of Peter Diamindis
the guy who wrote Abundance, arguing that the use of fossil fuels in recent history
has been a great benefit for the human race and has helped lift billions
of people out of poverty. Compared to wood and biomass, coal/gas almost
certainly is the lesser evil.

The author then begins to argue that contemporary people who argue that
fossil fuels will soon kill us all with global warming are no different
than (and sometimes were) people in the 80s who argued that global warming
and peak oil would have killed us by now. My responses to
that argument are:
  1) He's cherrypicking examples and the scientific consensus for
     global warming is much stronger than the evidence for those previous
     doomsday people.
  2) Global warming has in fact increased the temperature by a degree
     and we don't want anymore future warming.

The author argues that the reason fossil fuel use increased dramatically
pver the past few decades while renewables didn't is because renewables
were much more expensive and were unreliable. I grant both points, but
disagree when he says that will continue in the future. I disagree both
because of the exponential decrease in the cost of renewables and the
emergence of cheap batteries, which now can be used to phase out peaker
plants and in the future can be used to flatten the duck curve and store
excess power for when it's needed.

The author intends to present a utilitarian moral case for fossil fuels.
This isn't particularly surprising and is fine with me since I'm also
a utilitarian.

Epstein continues talking like an alternate universe Peter Diamindis by
talking about how the rapid increase in per capita fossil fuel usage in
India and China was associated with a corresponding increase in per-capita
gdp and life expectancy.
