# The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels by Alex Epstein

## Background
I have a coworker who's an Objectivist, when I went to his office
last time to ask him about something I noticed this book on his shelf.
As a side note, Alex Epstein is himself a former writer for the Ayn
Rand Institute.

This book seems like something I'm going to disagree with a lot, but
I'm reading it out of intellectual curiosity.

## Chapter 1 The Secret History of Fossil Fuels

The author starts out sounding like a twisted reflecion of Peter Diamindis
the guy who wrote Abundance, arguing that the use of fossil fuels in recent history
has been a great benefit for the human race and has helped lift billions
of people out of poverty. Compared to wood and biomass, coal/gas almost
certainly is the lesser evil.

The author then begins to argue that contemporary people who argue that
fossil fuels will soon kill us all with global warming are no different
than (and sometimes were) people in the 80s who argued that global warming
and peak oil would have killed us by now. My responses to
that argument are:
  1) He's cherrypicking examples and the scientific consensus for
     global warming is much stronger than the evidence for those previous
     doomsday people.
  2) Global warming has in fact increased the temperature by a degree
     and we don't want anymore future warming.

The author argues that the reason fossil fuel use increased dramatically
pver the past few decades while renewables didn't is because renewables
were much more expensive and were unreliable. I grant both points, but
disagree when he says that will continue in the future. I disagree both
because of the exponential decrease in the cost of renewables and the
emergence of cheap batteries, which now can be used to phase out peaker
plants and in the future can be used to flatten the duck curve and store
excess power for when it's needed.

The author intends to present a utilitarian moral case for fossil fuels.
This isn't particularly surprising and is fine with me since I'm also
a utilitarian.

Epstein continues talking like an alternate universe Peter Diamindis by
talking about how the rapid increase in per capita fossil fuel usage in
India and China was associated with a corresponding increase in per-capita
gdp and life expectancy. 

He demolishes the peak oil argument. This helps to show the age of the
book, since the idea that oil would run out is pretty dead now. The modern
replacement is people who believe that fossil fuel consumption is near a
peak and will decline under pressure from solar.

On page 19, when he starts arguing that fossil fuels can be used to impove
air/water quality by running filtration systems, he shows a graph of
pollutant emissions in the US declining under time. This doesn't really
help his argument since the EPA has heavily regulated emissions in the US
in order to make the graph look like that.

Next he shows a graph that despite a massive increase in fossil fuel usage
and atmospheric carbon, deaths from climate have declined 98% eighty years
ago. Looking at the graph it looks like most of those gains occured from
1900 to 1960 and there hasn't been much improvement since. If these gains
were really from using fossil fuels that graph would look differently.
It would probably be more reasonable to attribute that either to better
construction or to better weather prediction.

Then he has an anti-intellectual screed about listening to experts. I've
seen similar arguments before, but it can be phrased in a much more
charismatic way.

The author finishes his first chapter by advocating for a human-centric
version of utilitarianism and giving an overview of what he will talk about
in the next chapters. His argument for utilitarianism isn't very strong, but
I already agree with it so that's not much of an issue for me.
