# Azure

Free Trial comes with $200 of credit.

Hadoop is provided as Azure HDInsight.

VS Code is an IDE, it's very different from Visual Studio
despite the similar names.

There's a node package called azure-cli, which is useful to
manage azure projects from the command line.

I had some slight confusion when setting up azure-cli as to which
account I had associated with my free trial.
