## Vocab terms

* Kolmogorov Complexity - A measure of the complexity of a text,
  technically a non-computable function, correlates well with the
  compressibility of an input.
* Markov chain - A model similar to a finite-state machine, but instead
  of changing states based on input it changes state randomly.
* Variable-order Markov model - A Markov chain, but where the sequence
  of events leading us to a state can affect the probability of what state
  we go to next. Used by Shmilovici, Kahiri, Ben-Gal, and Hauser in a 2009
  paper.
* Thue-Morse sequence - A sequence made by repeated concatenation of
  its bitwise complement, starts at 0.
