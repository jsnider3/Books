# CPython

I'm interested in contributing to CPython. These are my notes on
the codebase.

## How to make and test

* ./configure --with-pydebug
* make -j2 && ./python -m test -j3

## How to debug

* Edit your .gdbinit to add it to the auto-load path.
  gdb will tell you if you don't do this.
* Run `gdb python` with your modified python binary.

## Mercurial Usage

* How to find out the author of a line of code?
** `hg annotate -u <filename>`

## Objects/rangeobject.c

Why does range(4,4) < range(3,6), but not range(4,5) < range(3,6)?
(Because that was python2 and we were comparing lists not rangeobjects)

range is implemented in Objects/rangeobject.c.

Itâ€™s cool that they have specialized range iterators for objects that
can and cannot fit in a long.

In python3, ranges are incomparable except for equality.

## Include/object.h

Py_DECREF and Py_INCREF are used for reference counting
(and garbage collecting), they require non-null objects.

Is python3 deployed to anything with a c int less than 16 bits?
object.h:682 leaves room for the possibility.

## Py_MEMCPY

Py_MEMCPY is defined in Include/pyport.h. It's #defined as memcpy,
except for when compiling with Visual Studio in which case it does
some optimizations for blocks smaller than 16.

## replace_interleave TODO

There's a TODO in Objects/byteobject.c to optimize a special case for
a single character. That seems like something I could do.

Those TODOs were originally put there in 2007.

There is also an identical TODO in Objects/bytearrayobject.c.
Both of these are in functions called replace_interleave which are
basically the same except for using bytes vs bytearrays.

The TODO in bytesobject.c was added by "benjamin" while the TODO in
bytearrayobject.c was added by "nnorwitz".

I made a change to do nothing if the count was 1 and test_bytes
test_dbm failed. This is good since it means test cases cover this
scenario and we thus have an easy way to know when we've fixed the problem.

What's confusing me now is the two lines bytesobject.c::2476-2477.
        *result_s++ = *self_s++;
        Py_MEMCPY(result_s, to_s, to_len);
Aren't these redundant?

replace_interleave implements the following: 
>>> b"Python".replace(b"", b".")
  b'.P.y.t.h.o.n.'

Doing nothing for count == 1 breaks (b"").replace(b"", b"."),
but not the previous thing.

I'm thinking the special case is to_len == 1, not count == 1.

How can I tell? Well, because I can do the optimization with to_len
only. Changing bytesobject.c accordingly fixed test_bytes. test_dbm
will probably be fixed by doing the same to bytearrayobject.c.

test_dbm was fixed after making that change in bytearrayobject.c.

Now to start writing an email to Core Mentoring.

Email was sent. Zackary responded saying that I should go ahead and
submit it with benchmarks. Age ain't nothing but a number.

Benchmark comparisons:
* Before (cold start):
>>> timeit.timeit('(b"x" * 2000000).replace(b"",b".")', number=1000)
7.619218342995737
* After (cold start):
>>> timeit.timeit('(b"x" * 2000000).replace(b"",b".")', number=1000)
2.7605581780080684
