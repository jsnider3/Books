# Samba

Samba is an open-source project that does cross-platform SMB/CIFS.
Specifically, it lets you share files from Windows to Linux/OSX
computers on the same network.

Unfortunately, the wiki seems to be victimized by spammers, so you
have to request an account manually. As of 2016/4/6, that's what I'm
waiting on.
