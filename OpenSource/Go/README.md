# README

Golang is a statically-typed programming language intended to compete
with C++. It also is a decent competitor against Python for some types
of quick scripting work.

Like a lot of open source projects it has a GitHub repo that is just
a mirror/bug-tracker. The authoritative repo is located at
https://go.googlesource.com/go.

Golang uses Lord Google's code review procedure basically.

## Implementing languages

Golang has 92 files written in C, plus 15 headers.
It has 1 file written in C++, but it's only like 10 lines.
It has 4289 files written in Go.

What can I conclude from that? Probably a lot, but I need more time
to assimilate that fact.
