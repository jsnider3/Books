# Issue 25386

msvcrt_putch/msvcrt_putwch don't check the return value of _putch/_putwch.

Looks like the changes need to be made around lines 240 and 258.

Eryk Sun wrote a test case for this. I might want to add it to the
actual test suite. What's the pythonw he uses?

I should add this to the what's new myself.

## Py_BEGIN/END_ALLOW_THREADS

I see a couple of these things in the msvcrt module code. What's it do?
* These allow other threads to run. If you're about to call a blocking
  function, you should wrap it in Py_BEGIN/END_ALLOW_THREADS in order to
  not kill the system's performance.

## Getting test script to run

Currently, I'm getting some weird access is denied error when I try to
run Eryk's test script. What if I run it as admin? That didn't do anything,
but changing the script to run sys.executable fixed it.

Eryk's test script was also supposed to read an EOF immediately, but for
me it uses my cmd's stdin. I think the solution is to pass the subprocess
the null device as stdin.

It turns out both of those were the wrong idea. There's a pythonw.exe which
I was supposed to use and originally I was looking in the wrong directory
for it.

## Doc updates

The msvcrt docs should mention that they will sometimes return an OSError.

The two places that would need to be changed are Doc/library/msvcrt.rst and
Doc/Misc/NEWS around line 830. If the maintainer wants to, he will add it to
whatsnew as well. What style should I make my changes in to fit in?
