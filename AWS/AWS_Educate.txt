# AWS Educate

Had some trouble logging in since I automatically log into my AWS account and got confused
because I didn't realize my Educate account was under my masonlive email.

Within AWS Educate, you can select career pathways. Who maintains those?

## Module Five Application Services

Starts with a presentation from Rich Houlihan from Amazon's DB team. Focusing on DynamoDB.

Generally, a database is a repository of information. In computing, it's a persistent store
for data.

Timeline of database technology consists of data pressure increasing and then being resolved
with new technology.
Database timelines:
* Brains - Lossy, hard to transfer
* Ledgers -
* Unit Records - Punch Cards, from the 1880s Census.
* Data drums - Linear access
* File systems - Random access, hard drives mostly
* RDMS - Try to prevent sprawling file systems.
* NoSQL - Currently, compute is expensive, storage is cheap. So we want a distriubted DB.

Currently, we have lots of data.

SQL                                 | noSQL
------------------------------------|--------------------------
Optimized for storage               | Optimized for compute
Normalized/relational               | Denormalized/hierarchical
Ad hoc queries                      | Instantiated views (You can make certain data easier to access)
Scale vertically (buy bigger boxes) | Scale horizontally (Shard data across more computers)
Good for offline analytics          | Built for online transaction processing at scale

## Iron Triangle of Data
* CAP theorem 
** Consistency - All clients always have the same view.
** Availability - All clients can always read and write.
** Parition Tolerance - The system works well despite physical network partitioins

Pick two, this is formally proven.

CA = MSSQL, Oracle, DB2, PostGres, MySQL, Vertica, Aster Data, Greenplum = Relational Databases
CP = Big Table, MongoDB, DynamoDB, Redis = Most non-relational databases
AP = Cassandra, Riak, Voldemort, Tokyo = Data replicated across nodes, updates replicates and resolve.

CA uses ACID transactions -> Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
CP, AP use BASE. Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent.

AP systems have to merge different changes when partitions come and go.
CP deals with partition tolerance by not allowing anymore writes.
