# Learn the Command Line

This covered basic Linix command line stuff such as these commands:
* ls
* pwd
* cd
* mkdir
* touch
* cp
* rm
* echo
* cat
* wc
* sort
* uniq
* grep
* env

It would complain if you type in any command other than
what it told you to do before finishing the lesson,
I feel that this discouraged experimentation.

You can use >> instead of > to redirect output to append to a file.

The console provided by the lesson was slow and once wouldn't show any
input for about five seconds. This was the buggiest Codecademy lesson
I've seen so far.

They taught us how to use nano, which was probably just a way to avoid
the vim vs. emacs flamewar.

By changing the value of PS1 in bash, we can change what the command
prompt looks like. For instance, we can make it a cheeseburger.
