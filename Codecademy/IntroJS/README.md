### Codecademy


#### JavaScript

The JavaScript tutorials have a thing for assigning anonymous
functions to variables as opposed to creating named functions.

I tried being clever when working through "Rock, Paper, Scissors", but
the game wanted to be annoying finicky.

It complained once about `==` vs `===` for comparing chars.
I don't get why, since both were known to already be chars.

When you do `for (key in object)` you're iterating object the strings of
the keys, not the corresponding values.

What happens if you do `for (elem in Array)`? Apparently, that loops over
defined indices.

Codecademy needs better responses when your code has invalid syntax.

I kinda feel like Codecademy gives me a broad, but not very deep knowledge.

I didn't know JavaScript had private variables. I wonder how much they're
actually used?
