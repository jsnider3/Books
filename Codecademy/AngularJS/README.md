### AngularJS

Angular directives seem to be pretty central. The idea is that they're
actions bound to html, right?

That's somewhat accurate. They are also similar to functions in that
we can give them arguments and they return an element.

You use {{struct.field}} to display a field in a struct, putting quotes
around it is sometimes necessary, but is not mandatory.

We have the date and number filters, these are both basically pretty
printers.
