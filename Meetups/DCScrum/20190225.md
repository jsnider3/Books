# What's REALLY Going On?
## Observational Skills Workshop by Julie Wyman and Mark Grove

Suppose you just joined a team as a coach / consultant / Scrum Master.
You decided the best way to start is to "simply" observe the team working.
What kinds of things would you observe?
Norm compliance, organizational strategies, comfort levels, lots of things, etc.

Body Language
* Crossed arms
* Leaning closer or away
* Pointing

Tone of voice
* Loud / soft
* When does it get louder / softer?
* Who does it?

Pronouns
* He/she instead of names
* Me and you instead of we

Physical space
* How are people positioned?
* Are people facing each other?
* What is being used?

Collaboration
* Is there a director / doers?
* Solo vs group working
* Who offers ideas? Who responds?
* Are disagreements shared?

Decision making
* Do people think out loud?
* How are decisions made? Consensus? Consultation? Direction?

Sharing your observations
* DO factually state what you observed in neutral language
* AVOID interpretation and assigning meaning to actions

Time to practice
* Two rounds
** Half of a table will build while the other observes
** Round two switches
