# Sean Killeen - "TeamCity, OctopusDeploy, and Azure"

Sean is one of Excella's .NET experts.

Going to do a live demo of his CICD pipeline in a blue/green scenario.
TeamCity is a Java-based build management and continuous integration server from JetBrains.
OctopusDeploy is an automated deployment tool.

He says it's better for the integration and deployment to be separated, because different
products might do deployment and integration better.

TeamCity builds projects and can host package.

What is blue/green deployment? The idea is that there can be two servers one blue one green
and the traffic can be rerouted between them after you finish the production smoke tests.

Octopus lets you have separate channels, like beta and GA streams.

LIVE DEMO IS NAO!
