## Future of work
@nitesh_indiez

50% of awake time is for work, which is unfortunate given how much work sucks.

#futureofwork is supposed to be a new lifestyle, not just remote, but location independent.

Used by: zapier, GitLab, WordPress, wework, Andela, WeWorkRemotely

How can startups leverage #futureofwork?
* Hiring: 
* Management: Agile/Scrum/Standups, only results count, heavy use of tools, leverage timezones
* Culture:

## What is an AR Sandbox?
Sharon Dempsey(?)

They filled a box with sand and then used Windows-based Magic Sand software by Thom Wolf and Rasmus Paulsen.

The basic app lets you make topographic maps that change as you play with the sand and which have simulated water features.

## Get the ETL out of Here
Trinh Lieu, Senior Manager, Developer Community

Not All Databases are Created Equal

Mainframe -> Relational -> NoSQL

### Data Migration Projects

We've probably all seen this before -- moving data into a new repository can be a new challenge.

Then, IT goes back to try to build a model to support business management.

Relational Databases with ETL sacrifice agility, timeliness, and cost

ETL: Extract, transform, load.

New, modern approach with MarkLogic: Load, Curate, Access
