# Painless End-to-End Testing with Cypress
By Brandon Lawrence

## Upcoming Meetups

July 25th is Introduction to Microservice Architecture

Lightning Talks in August at WeWorks White House. I should be presenting there.

## Presentation

End-to-End testing is a huge pain. Brandon went to AssertJS where he learned about
a new tool called Cypress. Speaker claims that Cypress can do TDD as well, but I'm
not sure that's as easy as implied.

Cypress was demoed with a small "Today I learned" app. Selenium was discussed as the
main competition. Cypress has a Chrome browser plugin. What other browsers does it
support?

He has a git alias to walk through a branch commit-by-commit.

Brandon used to work at CustomInk. He worked on the design lab. I've used that product.

Cool feature: Write the command to get an element by clicking on it.

I think Cypress doesn't support testing multiple tabs at once. There was a question
from the audience about it.

React works well with Cypress, but the presenter hasn't tested with other things, but
React shouldn't be doing anything exclusive.
