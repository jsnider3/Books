## Neural Network Timeline
1936: Alan Turing describes the Turing Machine
* Symbolic theory of cognition is born
1949: Donald Hebb publishes "The Organization of Behavior"
* Hebbian learning: "Cells that fire together wire together."
* Connectionist theory of cognition is born
1957: Frank ROsenblatt introduces the Perceptron algorithm
* Couldn't do XOR
1959: Hubel & Wiesel describe cascading (deep) layers of neurons in feline visual cortex
1969: Minsky & Papert publish "Perceptrons", causing a decade-long winter in NN research
1975: Werbos publishes the backpropagation algorithm
1986: Rumelhart, Hinton, et al. introduce backpropagation algorithm
1987: Rumelhart, McClelland, et al. publish "Parallel Distributed Processing" (PDP)
1990s
The "one learning algorithm" hypothesis emerges
1989: Metin & Frost teach (hamster) somatosensory cortex to see
1992: Roe et al. teach (ferret) auditory cortex how to see
Old skool commercial NNs make their way to consumers
* Dragon Naturally Speaking, etc.
2000s
"Deep" learning enters the vocabulary
2010s
DeepMind emerges to "solve AGI"
Yann LeCun joins Facebook as head of AI
Geoff Hinton joins Google

## Convulutional Neural Networks
Inspired by modular nesting in mammalian visual crotex
Achieve superhuman accuracy at image classification
* 2014: reCAPTCHA adds pictures, makes everyone's life worse
* 2015: Enlitic's app exceeds human radiologist accuracy
	at identifying cancer in CT scans
	
## REcurrent Neural Networks
2009: Alex Graves & Jurgen Schmidhuber win handwriting recognition
	competition w/ an RNN
2015: Google voice search improves performance by 49% by using
	LSTMs

## Generative Adversarial Networks
2014: Ian Goodfellow et al. of Facebook introduce GANs to improve
	self-teaching in large NN architectures
2016: Google Brain GAN creates it's own encryption cyphers
2018: A GAN creates "deepfake" video of Donald Trump.

## Reinforcement Learning meets NNs
2015: DeepMind publishes AlphaGo paper claiming high-level
	professional ability to play Go 
* Takes 1700 CPU years to train 
2017: DeepMind publishes AlphaZero paper claiming to improve
	AlphaGo performance beyond highest ELO rating ever
	achieved by humans
	
## Neural network toolchain
Python
Jupyter Notebooks
TensorFlow (Google)
* Keras
PyTorch (Facebook)
Theano (Bengio's lab)
* Entering long-term support soon
Caffe

## NNs on Lambda: Setup tools
Setup local toolchain
* git
* npm
* nvm
* direnv
* pyenv
* serverless
* serverless-package-python-functions

## NNs on Lambda: Inference (ImageNet)

## NNs on Lambda: Optimizations
Download pretrained models outside of handler code to keep in memroy
* Any code executed outside of the handler method will be invoked
	only once upon container creation and kept in memroy across
	calls to the same Lambda container, making subsequent calls
	to Lambda faster."
* Save time as long as your server is kept "warm".
The "if __name__ = '__main__':" trick

## Post-script: THe Circle of WHite (Men)
 Diversity Crisis in AI, 2017 Edition
* Word2vec is sexist
* Google Mistakenly Tags Black People as 'Gorillas'
