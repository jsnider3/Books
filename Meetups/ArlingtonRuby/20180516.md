GraphViz is to diagrams as Markdown is to text.

Things that will be covered:
* Nodes / connections
* Style
* Multiline text
* Grouping Nodes
* Applying styles globally
* Ordering affects how it's drawn
* Specify where on the node the connection attaches

GraphViz can have a .gz file extension.
graphviz.it is an online WYSIWYG editor for it.

There was an activity to draw a graph and then write
GraphViz for it. Below is my attempt:

digraph G {
  "User" -> "Runtime" [label="Audio"]
  "Runtime" -> "User" [label="Results"]
  subgraph cluster1 {
    label = "Server"
    "Runtime"
  }
}
