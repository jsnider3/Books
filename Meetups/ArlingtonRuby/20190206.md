# What Computer Scientists Know: Complexity Ain't Just for Wine and Cheese

This is a continuation of a series started at the previous meeting.

## Constant time
adding, getting head of array

## O(logn)
Binary search

## Linear time
largest(array)
One pass of bubble sort

## O(nlogn)
Proper comparative sorting

## n^2
Bubble sort

## Moore's Law
He talked about how computers getting faster can make problems tractable, but if we try using them on bigger
problems they can quickly go back to being intractable.

## Sudoku
You can construct sudoku-like puzzles for 4, 9, 16, 25.

Sudoku is O(k^n) complexity.

## Chess

## Eulerbusters?
Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares

## Karatsuba Algorithm
Possible to do by hand. O(n^log(3,2))

## Halting Problem

Imagine machines A and C that solve arithmetic and checkers respectively. They break if given bad input.

Then imagine a machine H that tells if a machine will halt for a given input.

H is logically impossible. Consider a machine that recurses on itself and negates the output.

The Collatz conjecture is one thing who's haltingness is a problem of interest.

For a lot of this I was expecting him to talk about AI-Complete problems.
