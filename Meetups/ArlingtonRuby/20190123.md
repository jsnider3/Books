## 26 Puzzle
Numbers one through 12 arranged in a Star of David so that each row
adds up to 26.

Might want to live code this.

I suggested a recursive descent approach.

is_board_solved(board):
	sum(row[0]) == 26 &&
	sum(row[1]) == 26 &&
	sum(row[2]) == 26 &&
	sum(row[3]) == 26 &&
	sum(row[4]) == 26 &&
	sum(row[5]) == 26


Naive solution is to just grind through all permutations

## Aristotle's Number Puzzle

Numbers one through nineteen arranged in a hexagon.
Each row has to add up to 38.

Grinding through permutations is intractable.

You can solve this by checking just a hexagon of 7 blocks and using
algebra to calculate the rest. This runs in approx. minute.

You can then take this approach and use it to solve the 26 puzzle with 7 numbers.

Then you can use linear algebra to do it even better.

Next month he plans to do a talk on complexity classes.
